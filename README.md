## My Wedding Site

This is a website that I am building as a challenge to see if I could create a better, more personal site than theknot's free site.  I am planning on hosting this site on vercel and am trying to keep the price tag under 20 dollars. This website is built with Next.js with a Postgresql database hosted on heroku for free. This site was bootstrapped with Create-Next-App

**Technologies used in making this**

1. Next.js
2. I decided to use the Grommet UI Library
3. Used CSS modules to style the site
4. Used a PostgreSQL database for data collection.

**Things that I am thinking about adding**
1. Possibly adding authentication with NextAuth using Providers
